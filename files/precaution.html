                    Cough or sneeze into your elbow - coughing or sneezing into your elbow catches the droplets<br>and stops them getting onto your hands. That means you won't spread the virus to other<br> people and make them sick too. You can also cough
                    or sneeze into tissues. Put any used<br> tissues in the bin or a bag immediately.Then wash your hands thoroughly. Then dry. </div>

                    Don't touch your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are dirty. Hands touch many surfaces and can <br> pick up viruses. Hands can then transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus
                    <br> can enter your body and can make you sick.

                    clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects, such as doorknobs. COVID-19 can remain
                    <br>on plastic and stainless steel surfaces for up to about 3 days and less than that for other types of surfaces.
                    <br> This will depend on the surface. If surfaces look dirty, clean them first. It 's best to use a disinfectant that is
                    <br> antiviral - follow instructions. Remember to store cleaners and disinfectants safely.

                    According to the World Health Organization (WHO), people will only need to wear a face mask if they are
                    <br> coughing, sneezing, or taking care of someone with COVID-19. Face masks are only effective if a person
                    <br> uses them correctly.

                    People should take care to avoid coming into close contact with others â€” especially those who are older,
                    <br> unwell, or have symptoms of the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend
                    <br>staying 6 feet away from anyone who is coughing or sneezing. This is because when a person coughs or
                    <br> sneezes, small droplets containing the virus leave their mouth and nose. Other people can then breathe these
                    <br> droplets in and catch any virus that the droplets may contain.

                    If a person has mild symptoms of COVID-19, they can self-isolate by staying at home and avoiding contact
                    <br> with others. Even if a person is unsure whether they have COVID-19, a common cold, or something else, it is
                    <br> best to stay inside and rest.

                    Anyone with a fever, cough, or difficulty breathing in an area with a COVID-19 outbreak should seek medical
                    <br> advice. Calling ahead before visiting a healthcare facility allows healthcare providers to reduce the risk of the

                    The CDC recommend that anyone at high risk of COVID-19 complications avoid cruise and air travel. People
                    <br> at lower risk can assess the potential risks of traveling, then decide whether it is best to postpone or cancel their
                    <br> travel plans. While the situation is constantly developing, many countries discourage nonessential travel and
                    <br> some have closed their borders to certain groups. </div>
